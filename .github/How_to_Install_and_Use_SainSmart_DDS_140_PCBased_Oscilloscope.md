# How to Install and Use SainSmart DDS 140 PC-Based Oscilloscope
 
If you are looking for a medium-performance oscilloscope that can also function as a signal generator and a logic analyzer, you might want to check out the SainSmart DDS 140 PC-Based Oscilloscope. This device can be connected to your computer via USB cable and run with a software application that allows you to display and analyze waveforms, generate signals, and capture logic data. In this article, we will show you how to install and use the SainSmart DDS 140 software on your Windows or Mac computer.

## Step 1: Plug in your device
 
Before you install the software, you need to plug in your SainSmart DDS 140 device to your computer using the USB cable provided. Windows or Mac will recognize it and have your computer to work with it. Please unplug other USB devices in case of interference from its high current.
 
## Step 2: Install the driver
 
The driver for the SainSmart DDS 140 device can be found under the folder âdriverâ in the software package. You can download the software package from [this link](http://wiki.sainsmart.com/index.php/SainSmart_DDS140_PC-Based_Oscilloscope). Depending on your operating system, you need to follow different instructions to install the driver.
 
- For Windows users, you need to run the file âInstallDriver.exeâ as administrator and follow the prompts to complete the installation.
- For Mac users, you need to run the file âInstallDriver.pkgâ and follow the prompts to complete the installation. You may need to restart your computer after the installation.

## Step 3: Run the software application
 
After installing the driver, you can run the software application for the SainSmart DDS 140 device. You can find the application under the folder âsoftwareâ in the software package. The application is called âDDS140.exeâ for Windows users and âDDS140.appâ for Mac users. You can also create a shortcut for the application on your desktop for easy access.
 
When you run the application, you will see a window that shows the zero voltage waveform of Channel 1. You can turn on CH2 by clicking on the button on the lower left corner, and it will show the waveform of Channel 2. You can also adjust various settings and parameters for each channel, such as voltage scale, time scale, trigger mode, etc.
 
## Step 4: Connect probes and test signals
 
To use the SainSmart DDS 140 device as an oscilloscope, you need to connect probes to the BNC ports on the device. The package comes with two oscilloscope probes (X1,X10) that you can use for different purposes. You can also use other compatible probes if you have them.
 
To test signals, you can use the small metal tip between the two BNC ports on the device. This tip will output a square wave signal of 1KHz with an maximum of about 3.3V. You can connect one of your probes to this tip and see the waveform on your software application.
 
You can also test other signals from external sources, such as function generators, sensors, circuits, etc. Just make sure that the signals are within the input range of the device (Â±40V) and that you use proper grounding and safety precautions.
 
## Step 5: Use other modules (optional)
 
The SainSmart DDS 140 device can also be extended to achieve signal generator and logic analyzer functions by inserting different sub-modules. The package comes with a signal generator module and a logic analyzer module that you can use for these purposes.
 
To use the signal generator module, you need to insert it into the slot on the right side of the device. Then you can use the software application to generate various types of signals, such as sine wave, square wave, triangle wave, etc. You can adjust parameters such as frequency, amplitude, duty cycle, etc. You can also use one of your probes to connect to the output port of the module and see the waveform on your software application.
 
To use the logic analyzer module, you need to insert it into the slot on the
